                "text": "Improving upon existing knowledge can be viewed as a way of reducing entropy in certain domains. This idea has been supported by various writers and scholars throughout history, with some being more influential than others.\n\n1. David Hilbert - One of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, David Hilbert, proposed that there are certain axioms for all mathematical systems which cannot be improved upon or surpassed without violating these foundations. By maintaining consistency among axioms and proving theorems using them, entropy can indeed decrease in mathematics.\n\n2. John Stuart Mill - In his book \"On Liberty,\" John Stuart Mill argues that knowledge is something mutable in nature but once produced or invented, it gains value because it can be used to produce further ideas. As a result, knowledge accumulation and preservation act as a safeguard against entropy by extending the reach of understanding beyond the current state.\n\n3. Alan Watts - According to this philosopher, human evolution results from a slow process of entropy, where organisms adapt their biology to survive in their environment while the environment also adapts to accommodate them. By learning and making adjustments within their environment, humans help preserve some level of stability against entropy.\r\n\r\n4. Nassim Nicholas Taleb - In his book \"The Butterfly Effect,\" he argues that innovation comes from unexpected situations; therefore, the higher a society's entropy (measure of disorder), the more innovative solutions will occur to counteract it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, knowledge accumulation and preservation work towards reducing entropy by expanding our understanding beyond what we know. The concept of entropy in physics helps support this argument as increasing entropy results in chaos whereas decreasing entropy results in order.\r\n\r\nMoreover, influential authors like David Hilbert emphasize consistency among axioms in mathematics that contribute to this idea. On the other hand, philosophers such Roderick Firth argue that the process of scientific progress is one in which entropy (or uncertainty) is constantly being reduced through the accumulation of knowledge. This perspective represents how human actions lead towards a decrease in entropy.",

Proponents of this view argue that cultural heritage should not be preserved at all costs, but instead used as a foundation for new ideas and approaches.\nThis approach differs from traditional views in that it encourages adaptation and growth, rather than adherence to strict rules or traditions. Traditional views may emphasize preserving cultural identity or heritage because they see these elements as important for maintaining the essence of a culture.\nAn example of how this concept has been applied in literature is J.K. Rowling's use of Harry Potter to explore themes related to identity, self-discovery, and personal growth. This approach allowed Rowling to incorporate modern ideas into her work without losing the core themes that make her stories special.\nIn philosophy, Michael Walzer's book \"Aspects of Mermaid Logic\" discusses the concept of constructive evolution in his exploration of the relationship between reason and imagination. Walzer argues that by embracing a creative approach to understanding the world, we can better appreciate our own heritage while also engaging with new ideas.\nNotable works that support this approach within literature include J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" and Toni Morrison's \"Beloved.\" In these works, authors explore themes of identity, personal growth, and adaptation through their unique perspectives.\nSome notable works that support this approach within philosophy include Peter Singer's discussion of animal welfare and Philippe Ariest\u00e8s' exploration of existentialism. Both authors use innovative approaches to challenge traditional views while also advancing our understanding of complex ideas.",
