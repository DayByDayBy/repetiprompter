She argues that while iteration may be necessary for incremental improvements, it should not replace continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nContinuous improvement involves making significant changes to a system or process over time, often resulting in exponential growth. By embracing continuous improvement, organizations can adapt to changing market conditions, improve efficiency, and ultimately achieve greater success.\r\n\r\nWhile both approaches have their benefits, Ashleystahl contends that iteration is better suited for incremental improvements while continuous improvement is better suited for significant changes.
