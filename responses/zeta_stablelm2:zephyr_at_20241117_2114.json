Jesus asks the young men for water, which ultimately escalates into a dispute over religious authority. The followers of Jesus then become angry with the young men, leading to them leaving town.\n\nIn response to this hostility, Jesus encounters a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years since birth after casting the power of healing over her. He miraculously heals her, and people from around the world come to witness the miracle.\n\nRegarding Jesus encountering followers of his being sent by God, in John 4:1-2 it says that \"Jesus realized how advanced religious knowledge was among the townspeople and had not received an equal reaction when he moved between cities.\" This indicates that Jesus likely knew he was performing miracles through divine intervention.\n\nIn John 4:39-41, it mentions that Jesus retreated from hostility towards his disciples after they asked why he had not ascended to God's throne. However, instead of rebuking them, he said, \"If you knew the Father and had seen me you would have been comforted even in prison.\" This shows that despite the hostility, Jesus also understands the importance of their relationship and comfort.\n\nTherefore, based on these descriptions, it is evident that Jesus encountered followers who believed they were sent by God during his interactions with various individuals. These followers did not believe that Jesus was sent by God but still followed him. Additionally, Jesus faced hostility from some followers for attempting to restore someone's health after a religious leader (Ephesians) had suggested otherwise. Nevertheless, Jesus continued to perform miracles, showing an understanding of their spiritual journey and the importance of relationships despite external pressures.",

However, after speaking with Moses and reflecting on God's promises, he realized that God had not abandoned him or Jerusalem. This realization strengthened his faith and determination to continue as God's leader.\n\nRegarding Joshua's decision to serve the leader of the Araphaim as a prophet according to the biblical account in Joshua 8:1-16, this event is clearly described in verses 5-7:\n\n\"Then the people of Jericho heard about what happened with their brothers in Israel and feared the same thing. So they turned to the Lord, offering burnt offerings and grain offerings on their mountains. It was at that time when Moses and the Israelites were nearing the land of Canaan. And Joshua's great power became evident.\"\n\nIn these verses, it is established that God had called Joshua as a prophet after he demonstrated determination and faith by serving the leader of the Araphaim. This event marks a turning point in Joshua's leadership and propels him to lead his people to conquer the land promised to them by God.",

For instance, if he were a respected hunter or warrior, using the name \"Beastmaster\" would not be as concerning. However, if he were seen as an outsider or an unconventional member of society, being called by his original name might stand out as odd and could provoke ridicule.\n\nFurthermore, Beastmaster's identity and role within the community may also play a significant role in how he experiences ridicule due to his name change. If he had always gone by \"Beastmaster\" and did not have a connection to his original name prior to adopting it as his new one, accepting and adapting to this situation might be easier. Conversely, if Beastmaster carried strong familial or cultural connections to his original name, adopting a foreign name might create a disconnect with the community he was leaving behind.\r\n\r\nIn summary, facing ridicule due to his original name being perceived as strange or difficult to pronounce in the village of Yagodna in the Eastern Slavs might stem from his social status within the community, whether it's respected for being a warrior or unconventional. Additionally, Beastmaster's connection with his previous identity and cultural background could also contribute to how he experiences ridicule surrounding his name change.",
